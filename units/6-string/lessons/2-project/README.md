##Scope

This project involves implementing the core functionality for a simple mad libs game. The objective of this project is for students to practice their string manipulation skills. 
 
##Before Class

### Prerequisites
Students should only start this project after they have completed the other lessons in the unit.

### Starter code

See [here](starter_code/) for code and [here](https://rawgit.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/curriculum/master/units/6-string/lessons/2-project/starter_code/index.html) to view.

### Solution code

See [here](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/solutions/tree/master/units/6-string/lessons/2-project/solution_code) for code (private).

### Assessment

1. Write do-now based off of [assessments from previous lesson](../../../6-string/lessons/1-string/assessments/).

##During Class

###Do Now

1. Attendance: http://scripted.org/attendance
2. Return graded do-now and exit ticket from previous class
3. Do-now quiz

###Opening

What is madlibs? Let's play a game together [here](http://www.madglibs.com/showglib.php?glibid=180).

###Lecture
You are going to build the guts of a madlibs game. You will be given starter code. Your instructions are:

#### 1. `runMadlibs()`

Modify `js/guts.js`. It must have the following function in it:
```
function runMadlibs(text, boy_name_1, noun_1, occupation_1, measurement_1, noun_2, 
					adjective_1, game_1, adjective_2, plural_noun, verb_ing_1)
```

You must create and implement this function. The `text` variable represents the text that you will need to modify. Print it out to the console to get more clues. The other parameters represent the values from the text boxes on the page. This function must return the modified text. 

###Brianstorming
Before you start coding, identify the list of steps you need to do to finish this project. Here's a start:

1. What string functions do you anticipate using? How do you use them?
2. Bring the starter code into your own environment.
3. Replace one word and check that your code works. Then move on to others.

###Build Time
Students will work alone on this project. The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any questions they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

###Extension Activities
Students who complete the project at hand early may attempt to improve their project by including the following:  

* Added CSS for visual customization
* A second MadLibs story
* Create a site in which the user is first prompted to choose between 2 or more MadLibs stories to fill in.

##Closing
Select students to present their work to the class.

###Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class.

###How to Submit
The teacher must ask students to share the link to their project on your school's [Project Submission Form.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheets/d/1kaVH9hmkDCbBul19583UMPxl6IJ3-4pHgBQ2BU6TKDk/edit#gid=0)

Also remind students to add a link to their project on their About Me page.
