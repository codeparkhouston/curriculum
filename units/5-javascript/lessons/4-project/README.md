##Scope

This project involves implementing the core functionality of a two-operand, integer calculator. The objective of this project is for students to practice creating variables and functions. They will also learn to research existing functions and call them when necessary. 
 
##Before Class

### Prerequisites
Students should only start this project after they have completed the other lessons in the unit.

### Starter code

See [here](starter_code/) for code and [here](https://rawgit.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/curriculum/master/units/5-javascript/lessons/4-project/starter_code/index.html) to view.

### Solution code

See [here](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/solutions/tree/master/units/5-javascript/lessons/4-project/solution_code) for code (private).

### Assessment

1. Write do-now based off of [assessments from previous lesson](../../../5-javascript/lessons/3-pseudocode/assessments/).

##During Class

###Do Now

1. Attendance: Teacher takes student attendance at www.kinvolved.com
2. Return graded do-now and exit ticket from previous class
3. Do-now quiz

###Opening

What is a calculator? How do we use one? Let's walk through every step we have to go through to figure out 10+11. 

For 10+11, what are the operands? What's the operator? And what's the result?

###Lecture
You are going to build the guts of a two-operand, integer calculator. You will be given some starter code. Instructions:

You are to modify `js/guts.js`. You will add the following functions to it:

```
multiply(x,y);
subtract(x,y);
add(x,y);
power(x,y);
square_root(x);
logBase10(x);
generateRandomNumber();
```

Note that `divide(x,y)` is already implemented for you as a sample.

Additional guidelines:

* Your functions must be named the same and take in the same parameters.
* Do not modify any of the other files. 
* Note that the "log" button is not natural log (base e) but log base 10.
* The random number button should generate a number between 1 and 1000.

###Brainstorming
Before you start coding, identify the list of steps you need to do to finish this project. Here's a start:

1. On paper, write down the formulas for each of the functions. Note the parameters you have to deal with.
2. Bring the starter code into your own environment.
3. Successfully solve your favorite function. Make sure it works before moving on to others.

###Build Time
Students will work alone on this project. The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any questions they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

###Extension Activities
Students who complete the project at hand early may attempt to improve their project by including the following:  

* Added CSS for visual customization
* A factorial function
* A quadratic formula function

##Closing
Select students to present their work to the class.

###Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class.

###How to Submit
The teacher must ask students to share the link to their project on your school's [Project Submission Form.](https://docs.google.com/a/scripted.org/spreadsheets/d/1kaVH9hmkDCbBul19583UMPxl6IJ3-4pHgBQ2BU6TKDk/edit#gid=0)

Also remind students to add a link to their project on their About Me page.
