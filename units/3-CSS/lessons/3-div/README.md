## Before class
---
###Teacher Preparation
* The teacher should become familiar with dash.ga.co project 3, section 1. Walking through this project should take an experienced html user 15 minutes. 

* Review what was covered last lesson to understand the level of skill students have with HTML. 

### Daily Objective

* Students will be able to create a webpage that includes classes and styles specific to div tags while working in the General Assembly tutorial environment. 


### Key points

* The main reason for working through this project is to give students exposure to div tags. That is why we are only covering section one of project three. Going further improves CSS skills but time will be used more effeciantly in the CSS unit which follows today's lesson

* A div tag allows you to style a group of elements with the same CSS. It is a multi-purpose tag.


### Assessment

1. Worksheet to accompany dash.ga.co tutorial (see references)


### Vocabulary

* Div
* Class
* Non-semantic

## During class

### Do-now

1. Attendance: Teacher takes student attendance at www.kinvolved.com
2. Give each student a General Assembly walkthrough worksheet (see references). Do not allow students to log onto the tutorial yet.

## Opening

"Today we are going to hop back on general assembly quickly to learn about a new tag. It's called a div tag. A div tag allows you to style a group of elements with the same CSS. It is a multi-purpose tag. It saves developers time when creating a site."

## Introduction of new material (“I Do”)
On the screen, the teacher will view the HTML for a website that uses div tags (So, just about any site online will do.)  
 Ask the students what they think a div tag is used for after you edit and delte some from the webpage. The conversation should lead to the fact that div tags groups parts of a webpage.  



## Guided Practice (“We Do”)

Have students log into their accounts on dash.ga.co. Remind them a bit of the interface and some best practices they should be using. 

## Independent practice ("You do")

•	Students should use the rest of class to complete project 3, section 1.

During this time teachers will circulate to help students with technical issues. If a majority of the class is struggling with the same issue you may consider demonstrating the solution on the board.  

Students who complete project 3, section 1 are encouraged to move further in project 3 assuming they completed the worksheet as well.

## Closing

## Check for understanding
Leave about 5 minutes at the end of class for there to be a discussion about what was learned today by completing a tutorial on General Assembly.

##Homework
Students who are not complete with the tutorial and/or the worksheet by the end of class should complete it at home for homework.

Students are also encourage to work through the rest of the dash.ga.co site on their own time to improve their skill past what is taught in class.
 
## After Class

* Teachers must provide a grade for the tutorial worksheet. It is crutial to provide this feedback so that students will see the value of their work.

* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
